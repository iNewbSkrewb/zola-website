As a college student, affordability and quick access are key, and the custom keyboard is just the opposite of that, so I decided to take on this project myself.<p>I figured if I were going to design the keyboard entirely myself, I might as well make it as <em>custom</em> as possible. I was going to design this keyboard something <em>just for myself</em>.<hr><h1 id=step-1-the-design>Step 1: The Design</h1><p>Within a few weeks of <a href=https://reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards rel=noopener target=_blank>snooping around online</a>, I discovered a whole world of bizarrely-shaped, split keyboards. I very quickly became inspired by the <a href=https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58 rel=noopener target=_blank>Lily58</a> and the <a href=https://github.com/foostan/crkbd rel=noopener target=_blank>Corne</a>. I learned that the motivation behind these strange layouts came from two goals that I had myself:<ol><li>Reducing finger movement<li>Enhanced typing comfort</ol><p>Both of these goals are achieved by two design choices:<ol><li>Less keys = less places for my fingers to go<li>Key placement matching the natural positioning of fingersâ€” meaning a split layout</ol><p>To start, I mapped out a rough layout by tracing my finger movements using a painting app on an iPad. <img alt="Traced finger positions" src=https://samienr.photography/Projects/keyboard1/finger_paint.png><p>That gave a basic idea of the where each finger naturally goes as I extend them.<p>As for hardware, I chose:<ul><li>Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 microcontroller for its Bluetooth Low Energy capability, affordable price, and ARM architecture.<li>Kalih Choc Red switches for their low profile and because I like linear switches</ul><hr><h1 id=step-2-ergogen>Step 2: Ergogen</h1><p>I needed a tool to design the layout and found <a href=https://ergogen.cache.works/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Ergogen</a>. , which uses a simple YAML format to create layouts. Thanks to <a href=https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-introduction/ rel=noopener target=_blank>a helpful blog series by FlatFootFox</a>, I defined a 3x6 grid for keys on each hand, matching the finger positions I had determined on the iPad. The flexibility of YAML allowed me to easily tweak the layout until it felt and looked right. Here's a snippet of my Ergogen config:<pre class="language-yaml z-code" data-lang=yaml><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span class="z-source z-yaml">      <span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml"><span class="z-entity z-name z-tag z-yaml">columns</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span>

I had to create and route the traces. Additionally, the footprint I used for the nRF52840 didn't account for its battery pads, so I had to modify the footprint by adding a small cutout to route battery wires through. I haven't messed around with PCBs before this besides some basic designs from school, so that was a nice learning experience. The supportive community on the <a href=https://discord.gg/kk4rXYkp4H rel=noopener target=_blank>Absolem Club Discord server</a> helped me through the process.<p><img alt src=https://samienr.photography/Projects/keyboard1/KiCad_before.png> The PCB Ergogen generated <img alt src=https://samienr.photography/Projects/keyboard1/KiCad_after.png> After adding traces and adjusting the microcontroller footprint<p>Once all the electronics were in place, I decided to add some decorative patterns to the pcb, as I decided not to use a plate on this keyboard. <img alt src=https://samienr.photography/Projects/keyboard1/final_pcb.png> And with that, the PCB design was pretty much done. All that was left was ordering everything and putting it all together.<h1 id=step-4-assembly-and-firmware>Step 4: Assembly and Firmware</h1><p>I ordered my PCB from <a href=https://jlcpcb.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>JLCPCB</a> in black and white for about 20 USD, the microcontroller from <a href=https://www.seeedstudio.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>SeeedStudio</a>, and the other components from <a href=https://typeractive.xyz/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Typeractive</a>.<p>I used my university's makerspace for soldering, learning about reflow soldering for small components.<p>(INCLUDE HOW I USED SHARPIE TO COLOR PCB EDGES)<h2 id=keymap>Keymap</h2><p>First, I defined the keymap. I opted for the Colemak-DH layout, as it was designed to be a more ergonomic layout that also allows for faster typing speeds.

I probably shouldâ€™ve planned these before designing the PCB, but I chose these pins retroactively, as the PCB traces were already routed.<table><thead><tr><th>Pin Number<th>Digital<th>Matrix mapping<tbody><tr><td>P0.02<td>0<td>Outer Column<tr><td>P0.03<td>1<td>Pinky Column<tr><td>P0.28<td>2<td>Middle Column + outerthumb<tr><td>P0.29<td>3<td>Index Column + middlethumb<tr><td>P0.04<td>4<td>Inner Column + innerthumb<tr><td>P1.12<td>7<td>Upper Row<tr><td>P1.13<td>8<td>Middle Row<tr><td>P1.14<td>9<td>Lower Row<tr><td>P1.15<td>10<td>Thumb Row</table><h3 id=creating-the-shield>Creating the shield</h3><p>Because this keyboard was completely original, there wasnâ€™t a pre-existing shield, so I had to make my own. That wasnâ€™t so bad. The <a href=https://zmk.dev/docs/development/new-shield rel=noopener target=_blank>ZMK documentation</a> is very well written and easy to follow.<p>All that was left was to compile and flash the firmware! <em>Not Really</em><h1 id=trouble-in-paradise>Trouble in Paradise</h1><p>Despite the careful planning and assembly, I ran into a significant issue: the left half of the keyboard worked perfectly and paired with my devices, but the right half was unresponsive.<h3 id=initial-diagnosis>Initial Diagnosis</h3><p>I tried resetting the firmware, suspecting an issue with the pairing process. This fixed the issue in that the right half now connected, but it also led me to find another problem: most keys on the right half were unresponsive, and pressing the top key in each column caused all keys in that column to ghost.<h3 id=physical-troubleshooting>Physical Troubleshooting</h3><p>I grabbed a multimeter to test each diode, as my soldering job for the right half was particularly ugly, but each diode was functioning correctly. Next, I tested each diode-switch pair, where I did find an inconsistency in voltages. I then tried flipping all the diodes, as perhaps the direction needed to be flipped because the board was flipped, but this yielded no change. It was time to take a look at the PCB.<h3 id=pcb-analysis>PCB Analysis</h3><p>I next decided to take a look at the PCB layout. This is where I found the culprit. I discovered that I had forgotten to route one of the pads on the backside (the front for the right side of the board). Fortunately, because the left and right halves of the board use the same PCB, I was able to simply resolder the microcontroller to the back side of the right half. I knew this would work because the left side worked flawlessly, and although the diode pads were on the other side, all the switch connections were through-holes, so the side on which they were installed would not matter. All that was left was to compensate with software by reversing the order of the pins. This finally worked.<h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>This project was a bit challenging but very rewarding, providing me with a custom mechanical keyboard tailored to my preferences. It was also my first truly original electronics project, and it taught me a lot about PCB design and soldering, all through practical hands-on experience. This project also helped in refining my independent problem-solving skills, as I am used to having either documentation or peers to take help from. I hope this inspires others to try their hand at DIY keyboard building!<p><img alt="The completed product" src=https://samienr.photography/Projects/keyboard1/keyboard.jpg></main><footer></footer></div>
