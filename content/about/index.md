# Hi, I'm Samien.<br>I like making cool things.

<style>p {font-family: "Source Code Pro"; line-height: 1.7; font-weight: 400;}</style>
I'm currently working on my Bachelor's degree in <colorize>Electrical and Computer Engineering</colorize> at *<colorize>The University of Texas at Austin</colorize>*, where I am also an undergraduate research assistant in Dan Wasserman's *Mid-IR Photonics Lab*. As of now, I am interested in <colorize>computer architecture</colorize>, <colorize>RF</colorize>, and <colorize>signal processing</colorize>.

I enjoy [photography](/photography) and designing+building ergonomic [keyboards](../tags/keyboards/), and also recently started tinkering with a [homelab server](placeholder).

When I have a little free time, I like <colorize>rock climbing</colorize>, watching <colorize>films</colorize>, and making <colorize>digital art</colorize>.

When I have A LOT of free time, I often work on animations that explain mathematical or engineering concepts using Grant Sanderson's (3Blue1Brown) [manim](https://www.manim.community/) Python library and <colorize>Adobe After Effects.</colorize>

I started this website to share whatever I learn with the world. Hopefully it offers benefit to someone!

If you have any inquiries or would just like to say hello, feel free to [reach out](../contact)! I'd love to hear from you.
